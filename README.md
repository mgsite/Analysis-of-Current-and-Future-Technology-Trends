# Analysis of Current and Future Technology Trends Using IBM Cognos

## Introduction

This project analyzes current and future technology trends using IBM Cognos for data visualization and insights. The primary goal is to explore trends in programming languages, databases, platforms, web frameworks, and demographics such as gender, age, and education levels in the tech industry. The dataset was visualized using widgets, providing valuable insights to support decision-making and forecast trends.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several key sections:

1. **Current Technology Usage**:
   - An overview of the most popular programming languages, databases, and platforms used in the industry.
   - Widgets rank the top 10 languages, databases, and platforms based on the number of respondents using them.

2. **Future Technology Trends**:
   - Forecasts of the most desired technologies for the upcoming year, including programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks.
   - Visualizations show trends in languages such as Python, Rust, and SQL, as well as databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

3. **Demographics**:
   - Analysis of demographic data such as gender distribution, age groups, and education levels among tech professionals.
   - Visualizations highlight diversity and experience levels in the tech industry.

## Key Insights

### 1. Top Programming Languages
- **Current Top 10 Languages**: Python, Java, and HTML/CSS are among the most commonly used languages, with Python leading in overall usage.
- **Future Language Trends**: Python and Rust are the most desired languages for the future, reflecting their growing popularity and importance.

### 2. Databases
- **Current Top 10 Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB dominate. Open-source databases are crucial in modern applications.
- **Future Database Preferences**: PostgreSQL and Redis are expected to see increased adoption, reflecting a shift toward scalable and high-performance databases.

### 3. Platforms
- **Current Usage**: AWS, Linux, and Docker are widely used, crucial for cloud-based development and containerization.
- **Future Platform Preferences**: Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform are expected to gain traction, reinforcing the trend toward cloud-native architectures.

### 4. Web Frameworks
- **Current Trends**: React.js, Django, and ASP.NET are the most popular frameworks, driven by the need for dynamic, scalable web apps.
- **Future Trends**: Interest in frameworks like Vue.js and Flask is growing, showing a shift toward lightweight and flexible tools for web development.

### 5. Demographics
- **Gender Distribution**: The tech industry is predominantly male, with men making up 93.5% of respondents.
- **Age and Education**: The age distribution shows a broad range of experience, with the majority of professionals being between 22-40 years old. Higher education is common, with many respondents holding bachelor’s or master’s degrees.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the current state and future trends in technology, focusing on programming languages, databases, platforms, and frameworks. Python and PostgreSQL are likely to maintain their leading positions, while new players like Rust, Kubernetes, and Redis are set to grow. Demographic analysis suggests that while the industry is still male-dominated, there is potential for increased diversity in the coming years. These insights can help businesses and developers align with the latest industry trends and make informed decisions about future technology adoption.
